After building the extension, you need to load it into Chrome:

Open the Chrome browser and navigate to chrome://extensions/.

Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.

Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the build folder within your project directory. This will load your extension into Chrome for testing.

You should now see the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar. Click it to open your extension.
